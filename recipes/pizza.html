    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>It's anything but a pizza margherita.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>3 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1 cup water</li>
      <li>1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</li>
      <li>1 pinch white sugar</li>
      <li>¼ cup flour for dusting</li>
      <li>2 cups pizza sauce</li>
      <li>20 slices fresh mozzarella cheese</li>
      <li>20 leaves fresh basil</li>
      <li>olive oil</li>
      <li>sea salt to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <em><strong>Step 1</strong></em>
        <p>Stir flour and 1 teaspoon salt in a bowl. Set aside.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <em><strong>Step 2</strong></em>
        <p>
          Mix water, yeast, and sugar in a large bowl. Let stand until yeast
          begins to form a creamy foam, about 5 minutes.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <em><strong>Step 3</strong></em>
        <p>
          Stir half the flour mixture into yeast mixture until no dry spots
          remain. Stir in remaining flour, 1/2 cup at a time, mixing well after
          each addition. When dough pulls together, turn it out onto a lightly
          floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 8 minutes.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <em><strong>Step 4</strong></em>
        <p>
          Lightly oil a large bowl, then place dough in the bowl and turn to
          coat with oil. Cover with a light cloth and let rise in a warm place
          (80 to 95 degrees F (27 to 35 degrees C)) until doubled in volume,
          about 1 hour. Punch dough down, divide into 4 equal pieces, and form
          each into a ball.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <em><strong>Step 5</strong></em>
        <p>Preheat oven with a pizza stone to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C).</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <em><strong>Step 6</strong></em>
        <p>
          Stretch out and pat 1 dough ball to form a circle 10 to 12 inches in
          diameter. Place dough on a lightly floured pizza peel. Top with 1/2
          cup of tomato sauce and spread to cover within an inch of the edge of
          the dough. Arrange 5 slices of mozzarella cheese on top of the tomato
          sauce, then place 5 basil leaves on top. Drizzle pizza with 1
          tablespoon olive oil and sprinkle with sea salt to taste. Repeat for 3
          remaining dough balls.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <em><strong>Step 7</strong></em>
        <p>
          Slide each pizza onto the pizza stone in the preheated oven. Bake
          until cheese is bubbly and the underside of the crust is golden brown,
          5 to 7 minutes.
        </p>
